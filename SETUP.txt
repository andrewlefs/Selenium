-Install Pear(go-pear.phar)
Dir:(D:\MECORP\wamp\bin\php\php5.5.12)
1 ) Locate the “php.ini” file. In my case, I found it at this path:
H:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.0\php.ini
2 ) Find the following line:
;phar.require_hash = On
3 ) Uncomment the “;phar.require_hash = On” line by removing the semi-colon.
4 ) Change “On” to “Off”.
phar.require_hash = Off
a)  If you installed phar file in the instruction above, then use command
 php go-pear.phar 
8 ) Now we need to edit the ‘php.ini’ again to add pear include path. Open ‘php.ini’ that we found in php5.3.0 folder and search for ‘go-pear’, you will see
;***** Added by go-pear 
include_path=".;H:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.0\pear" 
;*****
Copy these three lines and paste it to ‘php.ini’ file which is located at :
H:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.2.11\bin
10 ) Go to control panel –> system  and click on the ‘advanced system settings’ (it is on the left sidebar)
11 ) Click on the environment variables button and new/edit ‘PATH’ variable and add
‘H:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.0’
in your path. You also need to add a new variable ‘PHP_PEAR_PHP_BIN’ and set the value to
‘H:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.0\php.exe’
) Once PEAR  is updated, on command prompt type:
 pear channel-discover components.ez.no 
 pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
 pear channel-discover pear.symfony-project.com
4 )Finally type:
 pear install --alldeps phpunit/PHPUnit
